    "# AgentsVille Trip Planner - Project Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you'll implement an AI system to help you plan a trip--to the wonderful city of AgentsVille!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your AI system will demonstrate advanced LLM reasoning techniques including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Role-Based Prompting** - Your agent will act as a specialized travel planner\n",
    "2. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning** - Step-by-step planning of itineraries\n",
    "3. **ReAct Prompting** - Thought → Action → Observation cycles\n",
    "4. **Feedback Loops** - Self-evaluation using tools in the ReAct loop to find mistakes and improve plans\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll simulate external API calls to gather weather data and activities. Then, process this information to create personalized travel itineraries based on interests and other constraints. Last, you'll implement a feedback loop to refine the plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to build a travel agent that can plan the perfect AgentsVille vacation!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps you'll follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Vacation Details**\n",
    "    - Specify the trip duration, interests, and constraints.\n",
    "    - Use Pydantic to structure and verify this information in a class called `VacationInfo`.\n",
    "2. **Review Weather and Activity schedules**\n",
    "    - Simulate API calls to gather weather data and available activities in bulk\n",
    "    - Review the data manually to understand the available options\n",
    "3. **The ItineraryAgent**\n",
    "    - Implement an agent that generates a day-by-day itinerary based on the vacation details\n",
    "    - The system prompt will guide the agent's reasoning through a step-by-step planning process to take travel preferences (e.g. destination, dates, interests) and generate a detailed day-by-day itinerary\n",
    "    - Craft the components of the prompt (including the role, task/instructions, output format, examples, and context) to elicit the best possible itinerary in one LLM call\n",
    "4. **Evaluating the Itinerary**\n",
    "    - Evaluate the itinerary using a set of criteria to ensure a high-quality travel plan\n",
    "        - For instance, does the itinerary match the city and the dates requested?\n",
    "        - Or, is the total cost calulation accurate and is it within budget?\n",
    "        - Or, does the agent hallucinate any activities that are not available?\n",
    "        - Or, does the agent suggest activities that are not suitable for the weather? This specific evaluation function will require the use of an LLM to compare the event description against the weather data.\n",
    "5. **Defining the Tools**\n",
    "    - We will define four tools to assist the agent\n",
    "        - **calculator_tool**: to accurately calculate costs\n",
    "        - **get_activities_by_date_tool**: to retrieve activities for a specific date\n",
    "        - **run_evals_tool**: to evaluate the itinerary against the criteria\n",
    "        - **final_answer_tool**: to provide the final answer in a structured format\n",
    "6. **The ItineraryRevisionAgent**\n",
    "    - We will implement a second agent that revises the itinerary based on feedback using the ReAct THOUGHT → ACTION → OBSERVATION cycle.\n",
    "        - The LLM will first generated a THOUGHT / ACTION message, which contains reasoning steps and a tool call invocation.\n",
    "        - The Python code will parse the tool call and execute it, returning the result as a string to the LLM in an OBSERVATION message.\n",
    "        - After this cycle repeats n number of times, the LLM will invoke the final_answer_tool to signal to the Python code to end the loop and return the final answer.\n",
    "    - This agent will also **incorporate feedback on the initial itinerary** from the travelers to ensure the final plan has **at least 2 activities per day**. A new evaluation function using a powerful LLM will be created to check this user feedback.\n",
    "    - The agent will use the tools above to refine the plan iteratively, checking the weather and available activities, and ensuring the itinerary meets all constraints.\n",
    "7. **Something just for fun!**\n",
    "    - To wrap things up we'll create a fun, narrative summary of the trip, highlighting the best activities and experiences!"

       "Your upcoming trip to AgentsVille features two travelers: Yuri, age 30, who enjoys tennis, cooking, comedy, and technology, and Hiro, age 25, with interests in reading, music, theatre, and art. The trip is set from June 10 to June 12, 2025, with a total budget of 130 units and a planned total cost of 110 units, allowing for a comfortable experience within your means. The itinerary thoughtfully combines activities matching both travelers’ interests, considering weather and social settings.\n",
       "\n",
       "On June 10, you’ll enjoy a clear and warm day with a temperature around 31°C. The day offers two distinct activity options. First, a lively outdoor event called \"Serve & Savor: Tennis and Taste Luncheon\" brings together tennis and cooking enthusiasts for a friendly doubles match followed by a cooking workshop led by a local chef. This event is ideal for Yuri’s passions and offers a fresh, energetic lunchtime experience. In the evening, Hiro can engage in a cozy indoor gathering at The Ink Loft, perfect for writers and readers, featuring writing games, group prompts, and opportunities to share creative work—all set in a relaxed and inspiring atmosphere.\n",
       "\n",
       "On June 11, the weather will be partly cloudy with temperatures reaching about 34°C, offering good conditions for both indoor and outdoor activities. Midday, a Tech Lunch & Learn event will take place at The Digital Atrium, focusing on the latest in artificial intelligence. This event aligns well with Yuri’s interest in technology and also touches on Hiro’s musical, writing, and photography interests through tech demos and creative discussions. Later in the evening, a unique blend of art and cooking awaits at \"Palette & Palate,\" where participants will both paint and cook, combining Hiro’s love of art with Yuri’s culinary interests in an engaging indoor social setting.\n",
       "\n",
       "On your final day, June 12, expect a thunderstorm with temperatures around 28°C. A lunchtime event called \"Soundtrack Picnic: Lunchtime Movies & Melodies\" is set outdoors but includes an indoor alternative in case of rain, making it suitable despite the weather. This event pairs classic movie scenes with live music, appealing especially to Hiro’s musical tastes and love of movies. For the evening, \"Tech & Film Fusion Night\" offers an immersive indoor experience blending cutting-edge technology and cinema. It perfectly bridges Yuri’s enthusiasm for technology and Hiro’s interest in film, with discussions and screenings that explore the future of entertainment.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, your itinerary is well-balanced, offering a mix of outdoor and indoor events thoughtfully tailored to each traveler’s interests, and flexibility for weather conditions to ensure an enjoyable stay in AgentsVille."
