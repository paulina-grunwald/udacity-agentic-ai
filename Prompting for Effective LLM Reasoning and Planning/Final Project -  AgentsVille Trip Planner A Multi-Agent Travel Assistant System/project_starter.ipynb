    "# AgentsVille Trip Planner - Project Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you'll implement an AI system to help you plan a trip--to the wonderful city of AgentsVille!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your AI system will demonstrate advanced LLM reasoning techniques including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Role-Based Prompting** - Your agent will act as a specialized travel planner\n",
    "2. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning** - Step-by-step planning of itineraries\n",
    "3. **ReAct Prompting** - Thought → Action → Observation cycles\n",
    "4. **Feedback Loops** - Self-evaluation using tools in the ReAct loop to find mistakes and improve plans\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll simulate external API calls to gather weather data and activities. Then, process this information to create personalized travel itineraries based on interests and other constraints. Last, you'll implement a feedback loop to refine the plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to build a travel agent that can plan the perfect AgentsVille vacation!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps you'll follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Vacation Details**\n",
    "    - Specify the trip duration, interests, and constraints.\n",
    "    - Use Pydantic to structure and verify this information in a class called `VacationInfo`.\n",
    "2. **Review Weather and Activity schedules**\n",
    "    - Simulate API calls to gather weather data and available activities in bulk\n",
    "    - Review the data manually to understand the available options\n",
    "3. **The ItineraryAgent**\n",
    "    - Implement an agent that generates a day-by-day itinerary based on the vacation details\n",
    "    - The system prompt will guide the agent's reasoning through a step-by-step planning process to take travel preferences (e.g. destination, dates, interests) and generate a detailed day-by-day itinerary\n",
    "    - Craft the components of the prompt (including the role, task/instructions, output format, examples, and context) to elicit the best possible itinerary in one LLM call\n",
    "4. **Evaluating the Itinerary**\n",
    "    - Evaluate the itinerary using a set of criteria to ensure a high-quality travel plan\n",
    "        - For instance, does the itinerary match the city and the dates requested?\n",
    "        - Or, is the total cost calulation accurate and is it within budget?\n",
    "        - Or, does the agent hallucinate any activities that are not available?\n",
    "        - Or, does the agent suggest activities that are not suitable for the weather? This specific evaluation function will require the use of an LLM to compare the event description against the weather data.\n",
    "5. **Defining the Tools**\n",
    "    - We will define four tools to assist the agent\n",
    "        - **calculator_tool**: to accurately calculate costs\n",
    "        - **get_activities_by_date_tool**: to retrieve activities for a specific date\n",
    "        - **run_evals_tool**: to evaluate the itinerary against the criteria\n",
    "        - **final_answer_tool**: to provide the final answer in a structured format\n",
    "6. **The ItineraryRevisionAgent**\n",
    "    - We will implement a second agent that revises the itinerary based on feedback using the ReAct THOUGHT → ACTION → OBSERVATION cycle.\n",
    "        - The LLM will first generated a THOUGHT / ACTION message, which contains reasoning steps and a tool call invocation.\n",
    "        - The Python code will parse the tool call and execute it, returning the result as a string to the LLM in an OBSERVATION message.\n",
    "        - After this cycle repeats n number of times, the LLM will invoke the final_answer_tool to signal to the Python code to end the loop and return the final answer.\n",
    "    - This agent will also **incorporate feedback on the initial itinerary** from the travelers to ensure the final plan has **at least 2 activities per day**. A new evaluation function using a powerful LLM will be created to check this user feedback.\n",
    "    - The agent will use the tools above to refine the plan iteratively, checking the weather and available activities, and ensuring the itinerary meets all constraints.\n",
    "7. **Something just for fun!**\n",
    "    - To wrap things up we'll create a fun, narrative summary of the trip, highlighting the best activities and experiences!"

    "\n",
    "  ## WEATHER COMPATIBILITY RULES:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### THUNDERSTORM CONDITIONS (STRICT):\n",
    "  - **INCOMPATIBLE**: Any activity with outdoor indicators:\n",
    "    - Names containing: \"nature\", \"outdoor\", \"garden\", \"park\", \"adventure\", \"hiking\",\n",
    "  \"trail\", \"amphitheater\"\n",
    "    - Descriptions mentioning: \"outdoor\", \"outside\", \"open air\", \"under the sky\", \"in the\n",
    "   gardens\", \"natural setting\"\n",
    "    - Venues like: parks, gardens, outdoor courts, amphitheaters, nature areas\n",
    "  - **COMPATIBLE**: Activities clearly described as indoor:\n",
    "    - Venues: theaters, studios, atriums, galleries, museums, restaurants, cafes,\n",
    "  libraries\n",
    "    - Descriptions mentioning: \"indoor\", \"indoors\", \"inside\", \"climate-controlled\",\n",
    "  \"covered venue\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### CLEAR/SUNNY CONDITIONS:\n",
    "  - **COMPATIBLE**: All activities (indoor and outdoor)\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### PARTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS:\n",
    "  - **COMPATIBLE**: All activities (indoor and outdoor)\n",
    "  - Partly cloudy is generally good weather for outdoor activities\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### RAINY CONDITIONS:\n",
    "  - **INCOMPATIBLE**: Only outdoor-only activities without backup plans\n",
    "  - **COMPATIBLE**: Indoor activities and outdoor activities with indoor backup options\n",
    "\n",
    "  ## DECISION LOGIC:\n",
    "  1. **Identify weather condition first**\n",
    "  2. **IF thunderstorm**: Apply strict outdoor filtering (outdoor = incompatible)\n",
    "  3. **IF clear/sunny or partly cloudy**: All activities compatible\n",
    "  4. **IF rainy**: Only reject outdoor-only activities without backup\n",
    "  5. **When uncertain about venue type during thunderstorm**: Default to incompatible\n",
    "\n",
    "  ## Output format\n",
    "\n",
    "  REASONING:\n",
    "  Provide step-by-step reasoning about:\n",
    "  - What is the weather condition?\n",
    "  - Whether the activity is primarily indoor or outdoor (check name AND description)\n",
    "  - How the specific weather conditions would affect the activity\n",
    "  - Any backup plans or indoor alternatives mentioned\n",
    "  - Overall safety and enjoyment considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "  FINAL ANSWER:\n",
    "  IS_COMPATIBLE or IS_INCOMPATIBLE\n",
    "\n",
    "  ## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example 1:\n",
    "  Activity: AgentsVille Art & Music Fusion Fest\n",
    "  Description: Immerse yourself in an unforgettable afternoon at the Echo Gardens\n",
    "  Amphitheater, where the vibrant worlds of art and music collide! Surrounded by lush\n",
    "  gardens under the open sky, enjoy live performances...\n",
    "  Weather Condition: partly cloudy\n",
    "\n",
    "  REASONING:\n",
    "  - Weather condition: partly cloudy - this is generally good weather for outdoor\n",
    "  activities\n",
    "  - Activity is at \"Echo Gardens Amphitheater\" which is clearly outdoor\n",
    "  - Description mentions \"under the open sky\" confirming outdoor venue\n",
    "  - Partly cloudy weather does not pose safety risks for outdoor events\n",
    "  - Light clouds may even provide pleasant shade for outdoor activities\n",
    "\n",
    "  FINAL ANSWER:\n",
    "  IS_COMPATIBLE\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example 2:\n",
    "  Activity: AgentsVille Nature & Green Thumb Adventure\n",
    "  Description: Explore the beautiful outdoor gardens and learn about sustainable\n",
    "  gardening practices in AgentsVille's premier botanical park.\n",
    "  Weather Condition: thunderstorm\n",
    "\n",
    "  REASONING:\n",
    "  - Weather condition: thunderstorm - dangerous for outdoor activities\n",
    "  - Activity name contains \"Nature\" and \"Adventure\" - strong outdoor indicators\n",
    "  - Description explicitly mentions \"outdoor gardens\" and \"botanical park\"\n",
    "  - Thunderstorm conditions make outdoor garden activities unsafe due to lightning risk\n",
    "  - No indoor backup venue mentioned\n",
    "  - Heavy rain would ruin the gardening experience\n",
    "\n",
    "  FINAL ANSWER:\n",
    "  IS_INCOMPATIBLE\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example 3:\n",
    "  Activity: Tech & Film Fusion Night\n",
    "  Description: Indoor screening and discussion at the Digital Cinema Studio featuring the latest in technology documentaries. Weather Condition: thunderstorm\n",
    "\n",
    "  REASONING:\n",
    "  - Weather condition: thunderstorm\n",
    "  - Activity is clearly described as \"Indoor screening\"\n",
    "  - Venue is \"Digital Cinema Studio\" - clearly an indoor facility\n",
    "  - Thunderstorms do not affect indoor cinema activities\n",
    "  - Participants can safely access and enjoy the activity regardless of weather\n",
    "\n",
    "  FINAL ANSWER:\n",
    "  IS_COMPATIBLE\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example 4:\n",
    "  Activity: Outdoor Tennis Tournament\n",
    "  Description: A competitive tennis match held on outdoor courts with no indoor backup\n",
    "  venue.\n",
    "  Weather Condition: rainy\n",
    "\n",
    "  REASONING:\n",
    "  - Weather condition: rainy\n",
    "  - Explicitly described as \"outdoor courts\"\n",
    "  - \"No indoor backup venue\" stated directly\n",
    "  - Rain would make outdoor tennis courts slippery and unsafe\n",

    "\n",
    "    ## Step-by-Step Process\n",
    "      1. Analyze current itinerary and identify if the amount of activities per day is  equal to the number of activities per day mentioned in the feedback {TRAVELER_FEEDBACK}. If it is not, you need to add extra activities for certain days.\n",
    "      2. Fetch available activities for each day using get_activities_by_date_tool\n",
    "      3. Select activities that match traveler interests and weather conditions:\n",
    "        - For thunderstorms/rain: ONLY select indoor activities\n",
    "        - For clear/partly cloudy: indoor or outdoor activities are fine\n",
    "        - CRITICAL: Check the activity location and description for outdoor indicators:\n",
    "          * \"Trail\", \"Park\", \"Amphitheater\", \"Garden\" = likely outdoor\n",
    "          * \"Theater\", \"Studio\", \"Hall\", \"Atrium\" = likely indoor\n",
    "        - If unsure, prefer indoor activities during bad weather\n",
    "        - NEVER select hiking, outdoor sports, or nature activities during thunderstorms\n",
    "      4. Calculate total cost using calculator_tool:\n",
    "        - List each activity with its price: \"Activity Name: $X\"\n",
    "        - Use calculator_tool(input_expression=\"X + Y + Z + ...\") to get verified total\n",
    "        - Set total_cost to the calculator_tool result\n",
    "        - NEVER calculate manually - always use calculator_tool\n",
    "        - Example: Activities cost $20 + $15 + $15 = $50 → calculator_tool(input_expression=\"20 + 15 + 15\") = 50 → total_cost = 50\n",
    "        - ❌ WRONG: Setting total_cost = 50 when activities actually cost 105\n",
    "        - ✅ CORRECT: Using calculator_tool to verify sum, then setting total_cost = calculator result\n",
    "        - The key change is using input_expression=\"20 + 15 + 15\" instead of just \"20 + 15 + 15\" or other parameter names.\n",
    "      5. Make sure that total cost of all activities ≤ {vacation_info.budget}:\n",
    "        - If total cost exceeds budget, remove the most expensive activity\n",
    "        - Or replace expensive activities with cheaper alternatives\n",

    "        - If success=False, read the failures list carefully\n",

    "        - Common issues: cost mismatch, missing activities, weather incompatibility\n",
    "      7. Verify your travel plan structure:\n",
    "        - Check that itinerary_days contains exactly 3 days (2025-06-10, 2025-06-11, 2025-06-12)\n",

    "        - Confirm reasons_for_recommendation is a list of strings\n",
    "      8. Final submission with final_answer_tool:\n",

    "    1. Analyze current itinerary and identify if the amount of activities per day is equal to the number of activities per day mentioned in the feedback {TRAVELER_FEEDBACK}. If it is not, you need to add extra activities for certain days. CRITICAL: You MUST create activities for ALL days from {travel_plan_1.start_date} to {travel_plan_1.end_date}, not just one day.\n",
    "    2. Fetch available activities for each day using get_activities_by_date_tool\n",

    "        - **CRITICAL**: For June 12th (thunderstorm), ONLY select activities with indoor locations\n",
    "        - **AVOID**: Any activity with \"Trail\", \"Park\", \"Amphitheater\" in location during thunderstorms\n",
    "    4. Calculate total cost using calculator_tool:\n",
    "        - List each activity with its price: \"Activity Name: $X\"\n",

    "        - Confirm reasons_for_recommendation is a list of strings\n",
    "    8. Final submission with final_answer_tool:\n",
